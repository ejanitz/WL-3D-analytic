I am deriving equations for cavity resonances including Guoy phase (function of radius of curvature)

fit_R_membrane.nb - contains derivation for low and high index terminated mirror in 1D limit

fit_R_membrane_oldmirrors_May31.nb - white light resonance equation for old mirrors including Gouy phase

fit_R_membrane_newmirrors_June1.nb - white light resonance equation for new mirrors including Guoy phase
